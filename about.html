          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            MTN Nigeria was launched in 2001 as part of the MTN Group, which was
            originally founded in South Africa in 1994 as M-Cell. MTN Nigeria
            began operations on August 8, 2001, and made its first call at
            Maritime House, Apapa, Lagos, marking the beginning of a
            telecommunications revolution in Nigeria.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a proudly Nigerian company with a rich African heritage, MTN
            Nigeria has grown to become the largest mobile network operator in
            Nigeria and one of the most significant telecommunications companies
            in Africa. Over two decades, we have consistently invested in
            advanced communication infrastructure and innovative services.
          </p>

          <p>
            From our humble beginnings with limited network coverage, we have
            expanded to serve over 77 million subscribers across all 36 states
            and the Federal Capital Territory. Our journey has been marked by
            numerous milestones including the launch of 2G, 3G, 4G, and most
            recently, 5G services in Nigeria.
